# SumCloseZeroArray

# Sort the array in ascending order. This allows us to use a two-pointer approach.
Initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the sorted array, respectively.

Initialize two variables, closestSum and closestPair, to keep track of the closest sum and the pair of elements.

Set closestSum to a large value (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE) to ensure the initial closestSum can be updated.

Enter a loop that continues while the left pointer is less than the right pointer.

Calculate the sum of the current pair using arr[left] + arr[right].

If the absolute value of the current sum is smaller than the absolute value of the closestSum, update closestSum to the current sum and update closestPair to the current pair (arr[left] and arr[right]).

If the sum is negative, increment the left pointer to move towards a larger sum.

If the sum is positive, decrement the right pointer to move towards a smaller sum.

If the sum is zero, break out of the loop since we have found the closest pair with a sum of zero.

After the loop ends, return closestPair, which contains the pair of elements whose sum is closest to zero.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the size of the input array. The subsequent two-pointer traversal takes linear time, which is dominated by the sorting step.
